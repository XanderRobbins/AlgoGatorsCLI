"""Design stage: turn a plain-English instruction into an edit of a specific
strategy.py, by invoking either the `claude` (Claude Code) or `codex` (Codex
CLI) coding agent headlessly — whichever the user picks in the Design tab.

Both run scoped to a single research record's directory (`cwd`/`--cd` is the
record's own directory, which doesn't contain the rest of the codebase) with
tool access restricted to reading/editing files where each CLI supports that
(no Bash, no network for Claude; a workspace-write sandbox for Codex).

Both CLIs are invoked exactly as found on PATH, so whichever auth each is
logged in with (subscription vs. API key) is whatever gets used — this
module doesn't distinguish the two.
