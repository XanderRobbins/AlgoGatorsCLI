"""A widget that displays a matplotlib-rendered chart inside Textual.

Uses `textual-image`'s Sixel renderer directly — Windows Terminal has
supported Sixel by default since v1.22, no config needed. We deliberately
don't use `textual_image.widget.AutoImage`: its runtime protocol detection
sends a query escape sequence and reads the terminal's response, but
`textual_image`'s own source notes this "will not work anymore once Textual
is started" because Textual's stdin-reading thread grabs the response first.
That race most likely explains an earlier blank/black render — auto-detect
probably misfired and picked Kitty's graphics protocol, which Windows
Terminal has never implemented, so the escape codes were silently dropped.
Forcing Sixel skips that detection entirely.

The chart is rebuilt at the widget's actual pixel size whenever it resizes,
so it always fills its pane cleanly.
