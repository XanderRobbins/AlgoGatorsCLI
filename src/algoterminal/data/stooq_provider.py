"""Second free DataProvider, backed by Stooq's CSV endpoint.

Stooq needs no API key and has its own (inconsistent) per-asset-class symbol
conventions, so this is mostly useful as a fallback behind `YFinanceProvider`
inside a `CompositeProvider`. This tool is deliberately standalone from
AlgoGators' internal data feed — its data layer is meant to keep growing
with more free/public sources like this one, not be replaced by the fund's
real feed.

Note: Stooq has started fronting its CSV endpoint with a JS proof-of-work
bot check, so this may legitimately return empty results in some
environments — that's expected and handled gracefully by `CompositeProvider`
falling through to the next provider. It's kept here mainly to demonstrate
the multi-provider fallback pattern; no attempt is made to solve the
challenge, since that would mean evading a service's bot protection.
